<h1>My Personal Portfolio</h1>
<p>This contains Projects 1, 3, as well as an additional project from my film class!</p>

  <h2>Project 1: No Worries (Nonsense Poetry)</h2>
  <a href="https://adanie24.github.io/PROJECT_1_Reia_Daniel/"target="_blank">No Worries</a>
  <p>This project was based off of a prompt to create a poem that was essentially our most recent text messages to people compiled into something known as "nonsense poetry." Then, we had to look up an image that corresponds to our text messages via a search
  engine, and add that as an image to go along with our poem. Though it was true to my actual messages, it ended up turning out a little more coherent than I'd anticipated, and the image compliments it well.</p>

  <h2>Project 3: Ollie's House</h2>
<a href="https://adanie24.github.io/idea-120-project3/" target="_blank">Twine Project</a>
  <p>This project came about as a means of exploring Twine and learning how to make a text-adventure based game off of it, with branching options and styled text. Using Twine, I created a small, simple text adventure. It's about a boy named Ollie who ends up collecting
  and reading through old diary pages from when he was younger, thanks to his cat Buddy having found them from his roommate's bedroom. You get to reminisce alongside Ollie what his earlier years were like, and there are some more lighthearted options to
  balance out the more emotionally heavy moments.</p>

<h2>Additional Project: No Escape</h2>
  <p>(The video file is unfortunately too large. )</p>
  <p>This was my final project for my Film 170 class, that explores the theme of transformation as it pertains to the two main characters in the film, Benett and Juno. When Benett and his sibling Strawberry get separated and stuck in an arcade,
  Benett has to turn to an unlikely source of help: his ex, Juno. Together, they not only exchange banter and discuss what's led to the arcade's decay, but learn why their relationship failed in the first place. The voice acting and drawings were all done
  by me, along with found footage from Plexels, and some background music by Toby Fox, Bo Burnham, and an additional song from freemusicarchive.org.</p>
